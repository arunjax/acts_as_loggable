    ruby script/generate log_activity_files # This command will copy 3 files: helper file, RecentActivity model, and a migration file.

Lets log the signup process and edit profile process
Add these lines to user.rb:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


acts_as_loggable

after_create :create_signup_activity
after_save :create_profile_updated_activity

def create_signup_activity
    # Here '1' denotes the type of the activity i.e. user creation.
    # Also :user denotes the object who creates the activity.
    create_recent_activity(:user => self, :activity_type => 1) 
end

def create_profile_updated_activity
    if name_changed? || city_changed? || country_changed? # Create the recent activity only the any of these fields have changed.
        # Here '2' denotes the type of the activity i.e. edit profile.
        # If the user further updates his profile, no new record will be created. But it will simply update the time_stamp field of this record.
        create_recent_activity(:user => self, :activity_type => 2, :disable_further_logging_for => 15.minutes)
    end
end
